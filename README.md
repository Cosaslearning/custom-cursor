This project is a simple web application that enhances the user experience by implementing a custom cursor. Rather than the default cursor, it provides users with a customized cursor that follows their mouse movements. The project consists of an HTML file for the structure, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for cursor movement logic. Below, we provide an optimized version of the code with comments to explain each step.

**HTML File (index.html):**

- The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page, including references to an external CSS file (`style.css`) for styling and an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for cursor movement logic.
- It includes a `span` element with the `id` of "cursor" to represent the custom cursor on the page.

**CSS File (style.css):**

- The CSS file defines styles optimized for the custom cursor project.
- It sets the base styling to remove default margins and paddings and hides the system cursor (`cursor: none;`).
- CSS variables (`--cursor_color` and `--background_color`) are defined for cursor and background colors.
- The cursor is styled as a circular element with a gradient color.

**JavaScript File (script.js):**


- The JavaScript file defines variables and a function to move the custom cursor based on mouse coordinates.
- It listens for mouse movements and updates the cursor's position accordingly.


This web application enhances user interaction by providing a custom cursor that follows their mouse movements. It creates a visually appealing experience by replacing the default cursor with a customized circular element. The code structure and functionality have been optimized and well-commented for clarity and functionality. You can further customize the cursor's appearance and behavior to suit your specific project requirements.
